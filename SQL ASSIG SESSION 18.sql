# 1.Write an SQL query to display the total number of songs uploaded by each artist from a table 'songs' (columns: song_id, artist_name, title) and show only those artists who have uploaded more than 3 songs.

select *  from topsongs;

select artist,count(song_id) as total_songs
from topsongs
group by artist
having count(song_id)>3;

# 2. Given two tables, 'orders' (order_id, user_id, amount) and 'users' (user_id, username), write a SQL JOIN query to display each username along with their total order amount.	

select u.user_id,u.name,sum(o.amount) as total_amount
from users u
left join orders o
on u.user_id = o.user_id
group by u.user_id,u.name;

# 3. Write a SQL subquery to find the names of all restaurants from a 'restaurants' table (id, name, rating) whose rating is higher than the average rating of all restaurants.

SELECT name,rating
FROM restaurants
WHERE rating > (SELECT AVG(rating)
FROM restaurants);

# 4. Using a 'transactions' table (id, user_id, amount, transaction_date), write a SQL query with a window function to display each user's transaction amount and their running total (cumulative sum) ordered by transaction_date.

SELECT 
    user_id,
    transaction_date,
    amount,
    SUM(amount) OVER (
        PARTITION BY user_id
        ORDER BY transaction_date
    ) AS running_total
FROM transactions;

# 5. List two optimizations you would apply to speed up a query that filters Flipkart products by category and price, and briefly explain how each helps.<br><br><em><strong>Hint:</strong> Think about indexes and query structure.</em>
