-- Q 1. Create a SQL query using a subquery in the WHERE clause to find all restaurants from a 'Restaurants' table whose average rating is higher than the average rating of all restaurants in the city.

select * from restaurant r
where rating >(select avg(r.rating) from restaurant r
where r.city = r.city);

-- Q 2. Write a SQL query that uses a subquery in the SELECT statement to display each user's name from a 'Users' table
--  along with the total number of orders they have placed from an 'Orders' table, like a summary you might see in a Zomato user profile.

select u.name,( select count(*) from orders o
where o.user_id = u.user_id) as total_orders
from users u ;

-- Q 3. Given a 'Movies' table and a 'Reviews' table, write a SQL query using IN with a subquery to list all movies that have at least one review with a rating of 5 stars, as seen in BookMyShow's top-rated section.

select * from movies 
where movie_id in (select movie_id from reviews
where rating = 5);

-- Q 4. Write a nested SQL query to find the names of all sellers from a 'Sellers' table on a Flipkart-style platform 
-- who have sold products in every category listed in a 'Categories' table.<br><br><em><strong>Hint:</strong> Use nested subqueries to compare seller's categories with the complete list of categories.</em>
-- 1.
select s.seller_name from sellers s
where not exists (select c.category_id
from categories c
where not exists (select p.product_id
from products p 
where p.seller_id = s.seller_id
and p.category_id = c.category_id));


-- 2.
select s.seller_name from sellers s
join products p
on s.seller_id = p.seller_id
join categories c
on p.category_id = c.category_id
group by s.seller_id, s.seller_name
having count(distinct c.category_id) = (select count(*) 
from categories );
